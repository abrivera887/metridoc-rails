# Contributing

1. Branch off of `staging`.
2. Test building the Docker image and running the application locally.
3. Submit a PR. A maintainer will be notified and your PR will be reviewed once all tests pass in [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/metridoc/metridoc-rails) and there are no merge conflicts.
4. The maintainer will review and provide feedback. Once they approve your PR the maintainer will merge your commits.
5. Deploy your changes as soon as you are safely and conveniently able to do so.

## For Maintainers

Maintainers may merge their own PRs if no other maintainers are available. Code review is still strongly encouraged.
